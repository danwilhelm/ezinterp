# ezinterp

Minimalistic small/medium transformer interpretability library for interactive exploration (NumPy-based).
- `EZModel` stores the model weights, and
- `EZRun` stores the intermediate values of a model run.


Easily:
- Access all intermediate model values.
- Load, observe, and modify weights.
- Selectively disable or re-route nearly every aspect of the model.
- Compute special values useful for interpretability.

**NOTE:** This is an early, preliminary version. Naming and capabilities are not yet finalized.
